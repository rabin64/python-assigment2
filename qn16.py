#16. Imagine you are creating a Super Mario game. You need to define
#a class to represent Mario. What would it look like? If you aren't
#familiar with SuperMario, use your own favorite video or board game
#to model a player.


class Mario:
    def choice(self,multiplayer,singleplayer):
        pass

    def player_info(self):
        pass

    def Choose_level(self,level):
        pass

    def player_record(self,highscore):
        pass

    def show_current_score(self,current_score):
        pass

    def quit(self,terminate):
        pass
